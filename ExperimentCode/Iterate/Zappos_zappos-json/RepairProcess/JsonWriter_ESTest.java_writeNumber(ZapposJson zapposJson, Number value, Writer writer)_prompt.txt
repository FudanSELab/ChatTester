# Method Intention
The writeNumber method in the JsonWriter class is intended to format and write a given Number value using the specified ZapposJson instance to a provided Writer object.

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testWriteNumber() throws IOException {
        ZapposJson zapposJson = new ZapposJson();
        Number value = 42;
        Writer writer = new StringWriter();

# Instruction
The test method throw an error " org.junit.ComparisonFailure expected:<[4]2> but was:<[java.lang.Integer@000000001]2> " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
