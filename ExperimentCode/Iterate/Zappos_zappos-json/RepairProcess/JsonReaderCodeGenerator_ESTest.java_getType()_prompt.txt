# Method Intention
The getType() method in the TypeInfo class is intended to provide access to the type information stored in the class instance, allowing external code to retrieve and utilize the specific Class object associated with the TypeInfo instance.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
