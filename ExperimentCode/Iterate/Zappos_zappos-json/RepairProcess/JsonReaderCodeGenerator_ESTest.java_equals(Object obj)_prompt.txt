# Method Intention
The equals(Object obj) method is intended to compare two PathAndCode objects for equality based on their path attribute, ensuring that two objects are considered equal if their path values are equal, while also handling null values appropriately.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
