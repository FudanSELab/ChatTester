# Method Intention
The getField method is intended to retrieve a specific Field object by name from a given class, recursively searching through the class hierarchy if necessary, and throwing a NoSuchFieldException if the field does not exist in the class or its superclasses.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.

# Method Intention
The overall intention of the getField(Class<?> clazz, String fieldName) method is to recursively search for and return a Field object with the specified fieldName within the given class clazz or its superclasses, handling NoSuchFieldException by traversing up the class hierarchy until the field is found or until the Object class is reached.
