# Focal Method

# Method Intention
The getMethod() method in the JsonBeanAttribute class is intended to provide access to the Method object associated with a specific instance of the JsonBeanAttribute class, allowing external code to retrieve and potentially invoke the method represented by the object.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
