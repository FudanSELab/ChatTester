# Method Intention
The getSortedKeys method aims to return a list of keys from the input map in sorted order, providing a way to access and iterate over the keys in a predictable and organized manner.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
