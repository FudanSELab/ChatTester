# Method Intention
The isSuccess() method is intended to provide a way to check whether the verification process was successful by returning a boolean value indicating the success status of the verification result.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
