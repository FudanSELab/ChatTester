}

# Method Intention
The getSanitizedUrl() method is intended to return a sanitized version of the URL by removing any query string parameters and replacing any port numbers specified in the URL.

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testGetSanitizedUrl() {
        Verbs verb = Verbs.GET;
        String url = "http://example.com:8080/api/resource?id=123";

# Instruction
The test method throw an error " org.junit.ComparisonFailure expected:<http://example.com[]/api/resource> but was:<http://example.com[:8080]/api/resource> " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
