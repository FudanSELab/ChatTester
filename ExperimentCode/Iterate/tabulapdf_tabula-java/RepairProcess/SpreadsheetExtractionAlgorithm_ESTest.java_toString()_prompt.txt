# Method Intention
The intention of the toString() method in the PolygonVertex class is to provide a string representation of the object that includes the class name, the point coordinates, and the direction of the vertex.

# Instruction
Please generate a complete and compilable test method for the `Focal Method` based on the `Method Intention` and Class Information. 
The generated test method coverage for the focal method is as comprehensive as possible, and the generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
