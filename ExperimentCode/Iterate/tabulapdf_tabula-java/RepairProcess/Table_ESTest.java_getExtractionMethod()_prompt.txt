# Method Intention
The getExtractionMethod() method is intended to provide access to the extraction method used in the Table class, allowing external classes to retrieve and potentially utilize this information for further processing or analysis.

# Test Method
    @Test

        ExtractionAlgorithm extractionAlgorithm = new SpreadsheetExtractionAlgorithm();
        Table table = new Table(extractionAlgorithm);
        String extractionMethod = table.getExtractionMethod();
       [Generate an assertion statement here]


# Instruction
The test method throw an error " org.junit.ComparisonFailure expected:<[SpreadsheetExtractionAlgorithm]> but was:<[lattice]> " in "  ". 
Please analyze the code logic and method intention of the Focal method, then generate a correct assertion statement in the test method. Return the complete and compilable test method for the Focal method.
The generated code should be enclosed within ``` ```.
