# Focal method (Cannot be modified)
public float horizontalOverlap(Rectangle other) {
    return Math.max(0, Math.min(this.getRight(), other.getRight()) - Math.max(this.getLeft(), other.getLeft()));

# Method Intention
The horizontalOverlap(Rectangle other) method in the Rectangle class is intended to calculate the horizontal overlap between the current rectangle and another specified rectangle by determining the shared horizontal distance between their rightmost and leftmost edges, ensuring a non-negative result.

# Test Method
    @Test
    public void testHorizontalOverlap() {
        Rectangle rectangle1 = new Rectangle(0, 0, 5, 5);
        Rectangle rectangle2 = new Rectangle(3, 2, 6, 4);
        float expectedOverlap = 2; 
        float actualOverlap = rectangle1.horizontalOverlap(rectangle2);
